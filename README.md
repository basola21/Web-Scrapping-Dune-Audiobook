# Web-Scrapping-Dune-Audiobook
A program that downloads the audiobook for dune from the webpage : https://bookaudio.online/651-dune.html/

I made this project to test my web-scraping skills. Although it has a practical use because as the story goes, I like to hear audiobooks whenever I am doing secondary tasks and since most of that time, I do not have the luxury of an internet connection I decided to download the audiobook on my phone. Sure, there was easier ways of doing this, but this was the most fun way, anyway without boarding you to death with this unneeded chunk of words.
